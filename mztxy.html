        <code>Biography and Career</code>
        <p>Although Cheese Qi had been hosting various school events since he was young, it wasn't until his second year of high school that he learned—thanks to a teacher's recommendation—that "Broadcast Hosting" was an available major for the college entrance examination. During the summer break between his second and third year of high school, he met his first professional subject teacher, who introduced him to the name of the "Communication University of China" for the very first time.

In October of his final year in high school, Qi followed his teacher to Beijing, where the Communication University of China was holding its annual "Qi Yue Festival"—the highest-level national competition in the field of recitation art, also known as the "National College Student Recitation Conference". That experience solidified his determination to apply to the Communication University of China. After setting this goal, Qi began practicing his vocal training every morning on the school sports field.

During his first two years of university, Qi Sijun didn’t have a clear plan for his future career. His initial focus was simply to learn the professional skills from his instructors and to seize every opportunity to explore and gain experience. While interning, he worked in various roles related to program production—such as on-camera reporter, program director, and videographer. These experiences proved to be extremely valuable.  

By the time he reached his senior year, Qi received job offers from multiple media platforms during the interview season.</p>
